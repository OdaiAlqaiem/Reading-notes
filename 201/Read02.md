## Visual Editors
often resemble
word processors. Although
each editor will differ slightly,
there are some features that
are common to most editors
that allow you to control the
presentation of text.

## Their Code views
  show you the code
created by the visual editor so
you can manually edit it, or so
you can just enter new code
yourself. It is often activated
using a button with an icon
that says HTML or has angled
brackets. White space may be
added to the code by the editor
to make the code easier to read.

## Semantic Markup
There are some text elements that are not intended to affect thestructure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages. 

## Summary Text
+ HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

+ They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# INTRODUCING CSS
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.

- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

- Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.
