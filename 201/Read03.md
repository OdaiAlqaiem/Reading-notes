+ There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, 
unordered, and definition. 
+ Ordered lists use numbers.
+ Unordered lists use bullets.
+ Definition lists are used to define terminology.
+ Lists can be nested inside one another.

+ CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
+  You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
+ You can also control the borders, margin and padding 
for each box with CSS.
+ It is possible to hide elements using the display and 
visibility properties.
+ Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and 
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
+ Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of 
boxes containing text and the leading.
+ CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image 
borders and rounded borders.

# Decisions and Loops

- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) 
are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one 
set of comparison operators.
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code 
if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
- switch statements allow you to compare a value 
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default 
option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and 
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
