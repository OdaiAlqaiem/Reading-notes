+ The img element is used to add images to a web page.
+ You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
+ You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
+ Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.<hr><br><br>


# Color

+ Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
+ There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
+ Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
+ It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
+ CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
+ CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.<hr><br><br>

- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
+ You can control the space between lines of text, 
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
+ You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.<br><br><hr>


# JPEG & PNG & GIF

images don’t support transparency and are hence not usable for such cases. images support transparency in two ways — inserting an alpha channel that allows partial transparency or by declaring a single colour as transparent (index transparency). Partial transparency makes the edges blend smoothly into the background. PNG8 images (discussed in the “Colours” section below) can support only index transparency whereas PNG24 images can support alpha channel transparency.images support transparency by declaring a single colour in the colour palette as transparent (index transparency). Because of absence of partial transparency, the edges (specially rounded or too-detailed edges) get a poor jagged effect. Though this can be solved to some extent using dithering, with improved PNG support, GIF is unsuitable for images with transparent backgrounds.
